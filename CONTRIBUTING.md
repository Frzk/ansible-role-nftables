# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

  1. Fork the ansible-role-nftables repository
  2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
  3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.
